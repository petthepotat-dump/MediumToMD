# MediumToMD
**Scraped Medium and drops everything into a markdown file**

Medium limits to 2 articles per month (if you are logged in and have not subscribed) -- (benefits == recommendations)

However, people who are not logged in have unlimited, but no recommendations and no direct access to `member-only` articles.

Therefore, we abuse both to get stuff for fun :D

**Files are saved locally in the `product` folder**
